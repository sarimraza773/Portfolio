/*
 * Dark theme stylesheet for the updated portfolio site.
 *
 * This file overrides the CSS custom properties defined in the light theme
 * (style‑light.css) to provide a high‑contrast dark appearance. The rest
 * of the styling rules are inherited from the light theme via link order.
 * Importantly, only variables are defined here – the structural styles live
 * in the light theme to avoid duplication. To activate the dark theme,
 * include this stylesheet after style‑light.css in your HTML. Users can
 * switch between themes by swapping the order of the link tags or by
 * dynamically enabling/disabling the dark sheet via JavaScript.
